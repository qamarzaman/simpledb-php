# Introduction #

In SVN for this project is also an "ugly browser" in PGP for Amazon's SimpleDB.

This browser exercises the simpledb.php class.

# Details #

In the "sdbrowser" sub-directory, you will find an "ugly browser" which lets you navigate around domains, items, and properties, with add and delete support for each.  I'm sure someone will make a prettier one, but I really wanted to visualize what I was creating. And, I needed something to exercise the wrapper class.
